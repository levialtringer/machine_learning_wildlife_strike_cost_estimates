This repository contains the data and code for "Estimating Wildlife Strike Costs at US Airports: A Machine Learning Approach".

All data cleaning and analyses are performed in R statistical software.

The files contained in this repository are:

  1. `strike_data_raw.csv`
  2. `inf_adjust.csv`
  3. `strike_data_clean.csv`
  4. `clean_nwsd.R`
  5. `analysis.R`

To generate the cleaned data yourself, run the `clean_nwsd.R` script. This script draws on the `strike_data_raw.csv` and `inf_adjust.csv` data files to produce the `strike_data_clean.csv` file.

To perform the analysis and reproduce the objects presented in the paper, work through the `analysis.R` script. The script is annotated for ease of replication.

Questions concerning the analysis and research can be sent to <levi.altringer@colostate.edu>.
